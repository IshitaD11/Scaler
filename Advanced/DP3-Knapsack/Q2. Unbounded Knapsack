/* Q2. Unbounded Knapsack

Problem Description
Given a knapsack weight A and a set of items with certain value B[i] and weight C[i], we need to calculate maximum amount that could fit in this quantity.

This is different from classical Knapsack problem, here we are allowed to use unlimited number of instances of an item.



Problem Constraints
1 <= A <= 1000

1 <= |B| <= 1000

1 <= B[i] <= 1000

1 <= C[i] <= 1000



Input Format
First argument is the Weight of knapsack A

Second argument is the vector of values B

Third argument is the vector of weights C



Output Format
Return the maximum value that fills the knapsack completely



Example Input
Input 1:

A = 10
B = [5]
C = [10]
Input 2:

A = 10
B = [6, 7]
C = [5, 5]


Example Output
Output 1:

 5
Output 2:

14


Example Explanation
Explanation 1:

Only valid possibility is to take the given item.
Explanation 2:

Take the second item twice. */

public class Solution {
    public int solve(int A, int[] B, int[] C) {
        int n=B.length;
        // elements as row and capacity as column
        int[][] dp = new int[n+1][A+1]; //1 row extra to handle the 0th element selection. (A+1) cols for 0 to A

        for(int i=1;i<=n;i++) //0th row, no elements seleted, all values will be 0
        {
            for(int j=1;j<=A;j++) //1st col, capacity 0, values 0
            {
                int rej = dp[i-1][j];
                int sel = 0;
                if(j>=C[i-1])
                {
                    // ith row is mapped to (i-1) ele. As we took 1 extra row to handle first element edge case
                    sel = B[i-1] + dp[i][j-C[i-1]]; //if duplicates not allowed then: sel = B[i] + dp[i-1][j-C[i]];
                }
                dp[i][j] = Math.max(rej,sel);
            }
        }
        return dp[n][A];
    }
}
