Problem Description
There are N players, each with strength A[i]. when player i attack player j, player j strength reduces to max(0, A[j]-A[i]). When a player's strength reaches zero, it loses the game, and the game continues in the same manner among other players until only 1 survivor remains.

Can you tell the minimum health last surviving person can have?



Problem Constraints
1 <= N <= 100000

1 <= A[i] <= 1000000



Input Format
First and only argument of input contains a single integer array A.



Output Format
Return a single integer denoting minimum health of last person.



Example Input
Input 1:

 A = [6, 4]
Input 2:

 A = [2, 3, 4]


Example Output
Output 1:

 2
Output 2:

 1


Example Explanation
Explanation 1:

 Given strength array A = [6, 4]
 Second player attack first player, A =  [2, 4]
 First player attack second player twice. [2, 0]
Explanation 2:

 Given strength array A = [2, 3, 4]
 First player attack third player twice. [2, 3, 0]
 First player attack second player. [2, 1, 0]
 Second player attack first player twice. [0, 1, 0] */
 
 /* Observation: when we start from the lowest health person, we get minimum health 

When A[i] attacks A[j] and A[j]>= A[i] -->> A[j] = A[j]-A[i] 
and if it keeps attacking A[j] = A[j]-2A[i] ---> at the end A[j] becomes less than A[i]  --> A[j]=A[j]%A[i]  ---> GCD(A[i],A[j]) 
when A[j]<A[i] then A[j]=0 --> and player dies
So to get the minimum take GCD of whole array */
