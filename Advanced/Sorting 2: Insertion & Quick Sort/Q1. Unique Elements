/* Q1. Unique Elements

Problem Description
You are given an array A of N elements. You have to make all elements unique. To do so, in one step you can increase any number by one.

Find the minimum number of steps.



Problem Constraints
1 <= N <= 105
1 <= A[i] <= 109



Input Format
The only argument given is an Array A, having N integers.



Output Format
Return the minimum number of steps required to make all elements unique.



Example Input
Input 1:

 A = [1, 1, 3]
Input 2:

 A = [2, 4, 5]


Example Output
Output 1:

 1
Output 2:

 0


Example Explanation
Explanation 1:

 We can increase the value of 1st element by 1 in 1 step and will get all unique elements. i.e [2, 1, 3].
Explanation 2:

 All elements are distinct. */


public class Solution {
    public int solve(int[] A) {
        Arrays.sort(A);
        // System.out.println(Arrays.toString(A));
        int cnt = 0;

        for(int i=0;i<A.length-1;i++)
        {
            if(A[i+1]<=A[i])  //if (i+1) is equal or less than i then we need to increase A[i+1]
            {
                cnt += A[i]-A[i+1]+1;  //we need to increase A[i+1]=A[i]+1 --> this many steps would be required
                A[i+1]=A[i]+1;
            }
            
        }
        // System.out.println(Arrays.toString(A));
        return cnt;
    }
